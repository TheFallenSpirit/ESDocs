# Privacy Policy - Eternal Slave
The term “ES” throughout this document refers to Eternal Slave as an application on Discord.

The terms “user” and “users” throughout this document refer to user accounts on Discord as a service.

The term “server” and “servers” throughout this document refer to Discord servers on Discord as a service.

The following Privacy Policy outlines the data that Eternal Slave stores, and how this data is used across our services.


## Data Eternal Slave Collects
1. **Your BDSM profile.** All data you or your owners/trusted users provide regarding your ES user profile (BDSM profile) is stored and used to display your
profile and allow you to interact with other users using ES. This data includes but is not limited to: your owners, your trusted users, your BDSM position,
your kinks, your limits, your safeword, your bio, your avatar, your display name or username, your Discord user ID,
your profile brands, your profile rules, any active impairments, and any active restrictions.

2. **Server Configurations.** All data that is provided to us regarding your servers configuration is stored and is
used to customize and improve your servers experience on ES, as well as give you access to more features.

3. **Message Content.** All messages that ES can access are processed and checked to determine if the user is gagged, muted, or restricted.
The last 9 deleted and edited messages in every server channel that ES has access to are stored for up to 15 minutes and are permanently deleted after.
Stored messages are used for the snipe feature, and exclusively for that purpose.

4. **Confessions.** All confessions submitted to ES are permanently stored and are accessible by ES Staff and the administrators of the server
the confession was submitted in. This data is stored to ensure compliance with the server's rules where the confession was submitted.

5. **Tasks.** All tasks submitted to ES are stored until the task is removed, or in the case of writing tasks, permanently stored in an archived state once removed.
This data is used to provide a task list and a list of archived tasks available to a user and their owner on ES.

6. **Reports.** All reports submitted to ES are permanently stored. This data is used to ensure users are following the [ES Terms of Use](/legal/terms)
while using the reporting system. It may be accessed by ES Staff at any time for moderation and ES Terms of Use enforcement purposes.

7. **Safety Infractions.** All flags and restrictions issued by the ES Team privately or on the ES Safety Network are permanently stored and tied to users by
their unique user identifier (User ID). These flags or restrictions may include a provided reason for the infraction, and text or media based evidence for the
infraction. Because this data is used to ensure a safe experience for all ES users, it can't be deleted via a [Data Deletion Request](#viewing--deleting-your-data).

8. **Subscription Information.** When you subscribe to a premium plan, ES stores the following information: a unique subscription identifier,
the user id of the person subscribing, the user or server id of the entity receiving the premium benefits, the date of renewal for your subscription,
and the status of your subscription (active, cancelled, past due, expired). ES doesn't collect any other information regarding subscriptions,
